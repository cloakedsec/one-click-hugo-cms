**Before we get started, here's what you need:**

1. Basic knowledge of Spring Boot and Java.
2. An OpenWeatherMap API key. Don't worry; we'll guide you on how to get one.

## **Step 1: Set Up Your Spring Boot Project**

Imagine your Spring Boot project as the foundation for your weather app. We'll start by setting up this project and adding the necessary components. It's like preparing the canvas for a beautiful painting.

In your `pom.xml` file, add the following dependencies:

```

```

These dependencies include Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools, and Spring WebFlux. They are the building blocks of your weather app.

## **Step 2: Create a WeatherService**

Now, let's introduce the hero of our story: the `WeatherService`. This service class will be your go-to guide for talking to the OpenWeatherMap API and fetching weather data. Think of it as your trusted weather expert.

Here's how you create it:

```

```

## **Step 3: Create a WeatherData Class**

Now, let's create a `WeatherData` class. This class mirrors the structure of the data you'll get from the OpenWeatherMap API. It's like designing the frame for your weather picture.

```

```

## **Step 4: Update the Controller**

The controller is like the traffic cop of your app, directing requests and responses. We'll extend your existing controller to include a new endpoint for fetching weather data.

Here's how you can do it:

```

```

## **Step 5: Configure Application Properties**

For your app to work seamlessly, you need to set up some configuration properties. In your `application.properties` file, include these properties, especially your OpenWeatherMap API key.

```

```

## **Step 6: Modify the HTML View**

Now, let's spruce up your user interface. Update your `index.html` to include a city input form, making it super easy for users to search for the weather in their favorite places. You'll also add some JavaScript to send an AJAX request to your `/weather` endpoint.

Remember, this is where your users will interact with your weather app, so make it fun and user-friendly!

## **Step 7: Run Your Application**

It's showtime! Run your Spring Boot application and open it in your web browser. You'll be greeted by the updated index page with the new weather search feature. It's like taking your app out for a test drive!

And there you have it! You've just created your very own weather app powered by Spring Boot and the OpenWeatherMap API. You can customize and expand it further, adding features like error handling and user authentication. The sky's the limit!

Have fun building your personalized weather forecasting tool. Who knows, you might even impress your friends with your new tech skills! Enjoy the weather app-building adventure!
