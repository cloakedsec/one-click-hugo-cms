The Playwright UI Test Automation Framework is tailored to streamline component testing. It offers integrated reporting capabilities in multiple formats, making it easier to assess test results and troubleshoot issues. With its user-friendly folder structure and TypeScript scripting in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), it provides a seamless testing experience.

## Required Tools

Before diving into the framework, ensure you have the following tools:

* Visual Studio Code 1.79

## Language of Choice

The framework primarily uses TypeScript, a language known for its robustness and ability to enhance interactions with web applications.

## Framework Structure

The Playwright framework is a hybrid, combining the best of Playwright and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Reporting

The framework offers reporting with detailed screenshots, videos, and logs, making it easier to identify and diagnose issues in your application.

### 2. Multi-Environment Testing

Easily execute tests on multiple environments, ensuring your application performs consistently across different setups.

### 3. Parallel Test Execution

Run tests in parallel to save time and speed up the testing process.

### 4. Automatic Test Retry

For CI pipelines, the framework automatically retries failed tests, ensuring the stability of your testing process.

### 5. GitHub Actions Integration

The framework seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions, providing downloadable reports to facilitate collaboration among your development and testing teams.

### 6. Page Object Model (POM)

The framework follows the Page Object Model, an industry-proven design pattern that promotes organized, reusable, and maintainable test code.

## Project Structure

* **.github**: This directory contains YAML files for executing tests in GitHub Actions.
* **src**: All your test features and TypeScript code reside here.
* **reports**: This is where all report-related files are stored.

## Detailed Reports

The framework generates detailed reports in various formats:

* **HTML Report**: Easily accessible at `reports/YYYY-DD-MM/html-report`.
* **Allure Report**: Found at `reports/YYYY-DD-MM/allure-results`.
* **Monocart Report**: Located at `reports/YYYY-DD-MM/monocart`.
* **Logs**: Winston Logger logs can be viewed at `reports/logs`.
* **Screenshots, Test Videos, and Traces of Failure**: These are automatically captured to assist in debugging.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Begin by cloning or downloading the project from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pol-onesource/test-execution-orchestration-pol-bde-test).
2. Extract the project files and open them in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the project dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Use `npx playwright install` to install browsers.
5. Execute tests with `npm test`.

### Folder Structure

* `src\page-objects`: Houses all the page objects, representing UI screens.
* `src\test`: Contains all your test cases.
* `src\libraries`: Stores reusable libraries.
* `src\resources`: This is where you keep your test data and configuration files.
* `src\reports`: Holds all test reports.

## Designing a Test

1. Create Page Objects for your application screens, defining locators and reusable functions.
2. Ensure that Page classes extend the `FrameworkWrapper` class to make use of reusable functions.
3. Reusable methods are categorized as web and verify functions for clarity.
4. Include the Page object in `src\page-objects\base-test.ts` for easy access.
5. In your test fixtures, include the Page object in the test function.
6. Utilize `describe`, `it` (test steps), and tags for writing your tests.
7. Properties can be read from `src\resources\project.config.js` at any point in your test design.
8. Test data can be accessed using `TestData.getData("variableName")` for data-driven testing.

## Running Tests

* Run tests using `npm run test` or utilize Playwright commands.
* All run configurations are maintained in `playwright.config.ts`.

Incorporating automated UI testing into your development process has never been easier. With the Playwright UI Test Automation Framework, you can enhance the quality and reliability of your web applications while saving valuable development time.
